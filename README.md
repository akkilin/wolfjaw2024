Wolfjaw Game Jam - Connect

The theme of Connect led to create this project, although it isn't much of a game(?). Since the theme was connect, I build a 2 player game where a topic/theme is presented and the two players have to pick one object out of four, the players would have to mentally "connect". This project is pretty barebone and missing some features I wanted to get in (like a score system, a connection streak, theme/topic creator). 

**TO TEST: DOWNLOAD THE FOLDER ABOVE, EXTRACT AND RUN Mygame.exe** :D

Used GPT for some data generation (the theme and objects) to speed up coding process.
